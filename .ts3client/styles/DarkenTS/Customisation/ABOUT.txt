This new folder structure is another attempt to further streamline the procedure of customising your personal DarkenTS experience.

Unfortunately it still requires a little bit of manual work. Future plans involve a more comfortable, centralised and far more elegant way to make it even easier to customise DarkenTS, but that implementation date is written in the stars.

Thank you for you using DarkenTS!
